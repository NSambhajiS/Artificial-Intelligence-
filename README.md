This code solves the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem using a constraint satisfaction approach in Java. The problem involves three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat that can carry at most two people. The challenge is to ensure that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either bank, as this would result in the missionaries being eaten.
The program initializes the state with all missionaries and cannibals on the right bank and iteratively moves them to the left bank. The `display` function visualizes each step, showing the distribution of missionaries and cannibals on both banks and the position of the boat. The `solution` function contains the core logic for moving the boat back and forth, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at each step. The goal is achieved when all missionaries and cannibals are safely on the right bank.
This implementation provides a straightforward approach to understanding the principles of constraint satisfaction problems in artificial intelligence.
